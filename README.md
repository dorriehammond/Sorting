Notes on various sorting algorithms

## Complexity Analysis
| Algorithm | Time Complexity | | | Space Complexity |
| | Best | Average | Worst | Worst |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Quicksort | nlog(n) | nlog(n) | n^2 | log(n) |
| Bubble Sort | n | n^2 | n^2 | 1 |
| Selection Sort | n^2 | n^2 | n^2 | 1 |
| Insertion Sort | n | n^2 | n^2 | 1 |
| Mergesort | nlog(n) | nlog(n) | n^2 | log(n) |
| Heapsort | nlog(n) | nlog(n) | nlog(n) | 1 |
| Tree Sort | nlog(n) | nlog(n) | n^2 | n |
| Shell Sort | nlog(n) | n(log(n))^2 | n(log(n))^2 | 1 |
| Bucket Sort | n+k | n+k | n^2 | n |
| Radix Sort | nk | nk | nk | n+k |
